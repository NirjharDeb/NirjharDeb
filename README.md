## 👋 Welcome! 
My name is Nirjhar, and I'm a BS/MS CS student at Georgia Tech with industry and research experience in distributed systems, machine learning infrastructure, and large language models.

### 💼 Industry Experience
- Uber: Built ML pipelines and developed LLM-powered code linters to improve developer productivity.
- AT&T: Designed low-latency streaming technology for large-scale data delivery

### 👨‍🔬 Research Highlights
- Habanero Extreme Scale Software Lab: Developing a framework to safely remove yield calls in HClib, a C/C++ actor-based programming system for distributed systems.

### 💡 Interests
- With a strong foundation in computing systems and architecture, I’m eager to dive deeper into mathematically rigorous fields like machine learning, quantitative finance, and artificial intelligence.
